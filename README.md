# ParcelStarter3000 📦🐣
Quick starter for doing anything™ web with Parcel bundler

## What
This is just my basic configuration for starting anything be it a simple website or an experiment! It uses the amazingly uncomplicated and amazing Parcel bundler 🌈 because it's all about getting started!

## How
Assuming you already have node installed on your system
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into where you cloned it
- `yarn start`

That's it!

When you're ready to build just `yarn build`

## Extras
- This also includes a basic prettier config
- `yarn start` and `build` clears `.cache` every run
- `yarn build` also clears out your `dist` folder
- you can place static assets in `static` folder and they won't be file rev'ed

## Tip!
If you want to alias cloning this repo (as I do) just do e.g. in Terminal ```bootstrap MyProjectName```
Just do the following:
- open terminal
- `open ~/.bash_profile`
- add an `alias` config there for example `alias="bootstrap git@github.com:ezekielaquino/ParcelStarter3000.git"`
- save it
- reload terminal
- ta da! If you want to quickly begin a new project using this/or any other starter just type in `bootstrap [optional folder name]`
